Thanks to read README.txt. My README file was made by JJT and KMS. This file is supposed to explain how to use this program, This program is calculate the answers
of third dimensions equation. Unlike other programs, mine doesn't use the Cardano's method. Instead, I used Newton-Raphson method to find out one answer. And I use
it to downgrade the input equation. So input equation wiil turn to second dimension equation. Then, my program will execute to calculate other answers. Finally, 
the program will print three(or less) answers.
